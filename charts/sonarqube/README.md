# Sonarqube

[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/downloads/) is an open sourced code quality scanning tool.

Based on the initial work done upstream in the kubernetes chart repo [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/ea32ae30dcc8ac5b48ec1d869cfeec2e56bb3a6a/stable/sonarqube) but adapted for Openshift.

Due to this limitation https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/2247, the chart has been fully copied and adapted.
Once this is fixed, the mainstream chart should be reconsidered.
